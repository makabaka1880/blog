Welcome to this awesome new nuxt site! 

## Q0. What Should I Check Out
I made a cool [/about page](/about) page, and we are working on extending basic components and adding comments. Later on I'll add support for pagerank / embedding cosine similarity based recommendation systems or vis. 

## Q1. Why English
It's easier to embed thus easier to semantically search and compare. 

This allows cool stuff like mapping the site to a nondirected weighted graph to indicate similarity for recommendations, or just purely for cool visualization.

## Q2. Why Nuxt
It's **EXPRESSIVE**. My last blog was based on vue, so by using nuxt I also have much more experience than using gatsby and others. BTW My friend [@abloom](https://github.com/abloom25) made a blog `aflory` using nuxt and we've ever since wanted to extend that.
