*Giganticsymbolandlongequationsphobia* has long been a major issue for many students of science and mathematics.

As we all know, terror climbs monotonically with symbol size. Therefore, what students fear most is the kind of equation where multiple scaled-up versions of weird symbols stand shoulder-to-shoulder, staring down at them with fourtytwo different types of variable-binding notation.

And whenever anything gets hard, nerds begin to study it. In this case, people have actually found a way to formally and quantitatively prove things not about math, but about what we write about math : **METALOGIC**.

You're faced with two doors: one hides great wealth, the other doom. A cursed guardian stands at each door, and you may ask exactly one question. One guardian always tells the truth; the other always lies. What single question lets you pick the safe door?
